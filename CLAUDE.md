# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment Setup

The project uses a Python 3.11 virtualenv at `./venv`. Always activate it before running code:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

API keys go in `.env` (already present but empty). Required keys:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google Gemini (via `google-generativeai`)
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — Tavily search API
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` — Firecrawl web scraping

Optional: `GEMINI_API_KEY_2` — second Gemini key for key-pool rotation (all 4 agents consume it when set).
Optional: `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY_2` — second Firecrawl key; `shared/firecrawl_pool.py` rotates to it on 402/429 (credits exhausted) and prints one loud warning when all keys are exhausted.
Optional: `TAVILY_API_KEY_2` — second Tavily key; `shared/tavily_pool.py` rotates to it on 402/429/usage-limit errors and, once all keys are exhausted, prints one loud warning then raises `TavilyQuotaExhausted` (callers abort their Tavily-dependent loops and retry next run — there is no free fallback for search).

Load env vars in scripts with `python-dotenv` (`from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()`).

## Architecture Intent

This is a **multi-agent AI project**. The expected pattern:
- `agents/` — each file or subdirectory is a self-contained agent with a specific role
- `shared/` — cross-agent utilities: tool wrappers, prompt templates, common helpers

### Manual-entry override rule

The agents accept manually-inserted rows in `pathfinder_dashboard.xlsx` and
will enrich them on the next pipeline run:

- **Company_List** — insert a row with just `Company Name` + `Track` (blank
  Career URL). `company_agent.run_phase_1_5` detects the blank URL and calls
  `find_career_url` to discover an ATS/Workday URL, writing it back. Tavily
  must be available; rows that resist discovery are reported and left blank
  for retry. `Track` should be one of the 6 buckets (AI-native / Mid-large
  Tech / Robotics / Fintech / Space / Defense); unknown/custom values take
  the strict Mid-large-Tech per-JD classifier path with a logged warning.
- **JD_Tracker** — insert a row with just `JD URL` + `Company`. The job_agent
  picks it up via `get_incomplete_jd_rows` and runs full extraction. Note:
  manually-inserted rows pass the same write-time gates as discovery
  (geo/domain/YoE/work-auth, BUG-66) — a non-US JD URL will be skipped.

### User triage tabs (BUG-65)

`JD_ToApply` and `Skipped JD` are user-owned tabs (same columns as
JD_Tracker). Moving a reviewed row out of JD_Tracker into either tab is a
FINAL decision: those JD URLs are permanently excluded from re-scraping and
re-insertion. The pipeline never writes to or deletes from these tabs (it
only auto-creates them when missing). Do not rename them — the exclusion is
keyed on the exact tab names (`TRIAGE_SHEETS` in `shared/excel_store.py`).
Exclusion matches on canonical URL form (BUG-71,
`shared/excel_store.py:canonical_jd_url`), so tracking-param or host/path
variants of a triaged posting are also excluded.

## Running Agents

No build step. Run agents directly:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/<agent_name>.py
```

## Custom Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Development-time agents invoked via the Agent tool, organized into three groups under the user (Architect / Product Owner), alongside the Implementation group (the Claude Code main thread itself):

| Agent | Model | Group | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product-manager` | sonnet | 📋 Planning | Research, feasibility analysis, BRD writing, testing sign-off, decision support |
| `tpm` | opus | 📋 Planning | Task decomposition, coordination, risk management, progress reporting, launch readiness |
| `agent-reviewer` | opus | 🔍 Quality | Review agent code quality, prompt design, cross-agent consistency |
| `api-debugger` | sonnet | 🔍 Quality | Debug Gemini/Tavily/Firecrawl/ATS API issues |
| `schema-validator` | sonnet | 🔍 Quality | Validate Excel sheet schemas and inter-agent data contracts |
| `test-analyzer` | sonnet | 🔍 Quality | Analyze test failures, identify coverage gaps |
| `doc-sync` | sonnet | 🔍 Quality | Detect documentation drift (REQUIREMENTS/ARCHITECTURE/BUGS/CHANGELOG) |
| `bug-tracker` | sonnet | 🔍 Quality | Manage BUGS.md: verify status, scan new bugs, suggest regression tests |
| `eval-engineer` | sonnet | 📊 Evaluation | AI output quality evaluation: scoring calibration, prompt regression, hallucination detection |
| `observability` | sonnet | 📊 Evaluation | Pipeline run reporting, output quality drift detection, anomaly alerting |
| `cost` | sonnet | 📊 Evaluation | API token usage estimation, quota monitoring, cost optimization recommendations |

All 11 agents carry no Edit/Write tools (analysis-only by design; `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`). Each group authors its own deliverables (Planning: requirements & milestones; Quality: test plans & review reports; Evaluation: eval & cost reports), drafted by the agents and persisted via the Claude Code main thread — which alone holds code write access.

## SDLC Workflow (`docs/sdlc/`)

5-phase workflow coordinated by TPM Agent: BRD → Tech Design → Implementation → Testing → Launch.

Each project lives in `docs/sdlc/PRJ-xxx-<name>/` with `status.md` as single source of truth.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdlc-init` | Initialize new SDLC project with ID, directory, and templates |
| `/sdlc-status` | View project status (single project or all active) |
| `/sdlc-review` | Trigger stage-specific reviews (brd/design/testing/launch) |

## Installing New Dependencies

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install <package>
```
